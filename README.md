# Team-Concorde
This GitHub repository stores the code and analysis of DAEN 690’s group “Concord”. This project is focused on the airline industry and the hierarchy of risk associated. Code and analysis will be provided to try and extract information from narratives of minor to unsafe acts in the airline industry. This is being done to try and increase knowledge and safety in many aspects of the airline industry. This repository will focus on using programming languages to create Natural Language Processing models that will extract information about certain incidents and safety hazards from a dataset of 25,000 instances between 1 and 4 sentences long. These extractions can then be used to further understand problems that may happen in the future.
